Everything points to this being a saltwater ray, but Manta mobula has developed the ability to swim into the island's rivers and shallows, as well as through the open ocean. Perhaps there were originally two types of ray on the island before, but years of interbreeding combined their lineage. Normally docile, Manta mobula is a carnivore only in that it naturally consumes plankton."}]
