This act of desperation triggered a horrifying transformation, warping his mind and body into a monstrous entity.

His story begins on the Aberrant ARK, a mysterious and dangerous environment filled with mutated creatures and corrupted landscapes. Santiago wakes up with no memory of how he got there, but he quickly realizes that the world he once knew is gone, devastated by the rampant spread of Element, a powerful and corruptive substance.

Driven by a fierce determination to understand and combat the effects of Element, Santiago becomes a key figure in the fight for survival. His expertise in technology and engineering allows him to create advanced Tek gear and weapons, which are crucial for defending against the threats posed by the corrupted creatures and hostile survivors. Santiago’s knowledge of Element and its properties makes him invaluable to his tribe, as they struggle to reclaim their world from the chaos and destruction caused by this mysterious substance.

Throughout his journey, Santiago faces numerous challenges and battles, both against the environment and other survivors who have been driven mad by the influence of Element. Despite the odds, he remains steadfast in his mission to find a way to stop the spread of Element and restore balance to the world. His story is one of resilience, ingenuity, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge in the face of overwhelming adversity.",

Throughout the game, HLN-A offers insights into the lore of the ARK universe, revealing bits of Helena’s own story and the broader narrative of the ARKs. She also helps players by marking mission objectives, offering tips, and even providing some comic relief with her witty remarks.

HLN-A’s presence is a constant reminder of Helena Walker’s legacy and her efforts to ensure the survival and success of future generations of survivors. Her guidance is invaluable as players strive to uncover the mysteries of the Genesis Simulation and ultimately, the true purpose of the ARKs.",
