Fascinated by the island’s unique flora and fauna, Rockwell’s curiosity led him to experiment with a mysterious substance known as Element, or Edmundium.

As Rockwell delved deeper into his research, he became obsessed with the power and potential of Element. His experiments grew increasingly dangerous and unhinged, leading him to inject himself with the substance. This act of desperation triggered a horrifying transformation, warping his mind and body into a monstrous entity.

Now, Rockwell reigns as a twisted overlord in the depths of the Aberration ARK, his once brilliant mind consumed by madness. His ultimate goal is to harness the full power of Element to ascend to godhood, regardless of the cost to himself or the world around him.",
